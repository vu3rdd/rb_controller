Controller

- RIT and other encoder CW rotation initially goes down one step
  before advancing up.
- LSB/USB switching around 10MHz.
- long press of LSB/USB to toggle it.
- velocity on VFO optical Encoder to increase step size dynamically.

PiHPSDR

- Fonts/typeface sizes are too small
- A lot of wasted area at the top
- ctune should move the panadaptor.
- Filter appearance on panadaptor leaves out ~100-150Hz.
